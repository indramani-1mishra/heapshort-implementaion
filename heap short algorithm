Steps of the Heapsort Algorithm
Build a Max Heap:
Convert the array into a max heap structure. In a max heap, for every node 
𝑖 i, the value of 𝑖
i is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
Extract Elements from the Heap:
The root of the max heap (the largest element) is swapped with the last element of the heap. This effectively reduces the size of the heap by one.
The heap property is restored by calling the maxheapify function on the root of the heap.
Repeat the process until the heap is empty.
